📌 Experiment

Title:
Implementation of SQL SELECT Queries with Filtering, Sorting, Grouping, and Aggregation in PostgreSQL

Description:
This experiment focuses on implementing SQL SELECT queries in PostgreSQL to retrieve and analyze data efficiently. The practical demonstrates how filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregation techniques are used in real-world database applications for reporting and decision-making.

<hr>

🎯 Objective

The objectives of this experiment are:

To retrieve specific records using filtering conditions

To sort query results using single and multiple attributes

To perform aggregation using the GROUP BY clause

To apply conditions on aggregated data using the HAVING clause

To understand the difference between row-level filtering and group-level filtering

To gain practical exposure to SQL queries commonly asked in placement interviews

<hr>

🧪 Practical / Experiment Steps

Create a PostgreSQL database for the experiment

Create a table to store customer order details

Insert sample records into the table

Retrieve records using filtering conditions (WHERE clause)

Sort query results in ascending and descending order

Apply sorting on multiple columns

Group data based on a common attribute

Calculate aggregate values such as total sales

Apply conditions on aggregated data using the HAVING clause

Verify and analyze the output obtained

⚙️ Procedure of the Experiment and Screenshots

The system was started and logged in successfully.

PostgreSQL client tool (psql / pgAdmin) was opened.

A table named customer_orders was created to store order details such as customer name, product, quantity, price, and order date.

Sample data was inserted into the table for analysis.

SQL queries were executed to filter records using the WHERE clause.

Sorting operations were performed using ORDER BY in both ascending and descending order.

Multiple-column sorting was implemented to observe priority-based sorting.

Aggregation was performed using the GROUP BY clause to calculate total sales per product.

The HAVING clause was used to filter grouped data based on aggregate conditions.

Outputs were verified, noted, and screenshots were taken for record and submission.
